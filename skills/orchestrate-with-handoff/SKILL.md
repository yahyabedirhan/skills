# Orchestrate With Handoff

Start work without asking the maintainer for a go-ahead: they gave it when they handed the effort over to you.

1. Read the handoff. Confirm you are in the worktree and on the branch it names; if not, say so and stop, because the effort's commits belong on that branch in that worktree.
2. Run `/orchestrate-effort` on the spec and tickets the handoff names, and on the handoff itself.

When the spec, tickets and handoff leave a question open, and the handoff says the session that wrote it can still be reached, look for the answer in that session before you decide the question yourself. That session may know what the handoff left out.
