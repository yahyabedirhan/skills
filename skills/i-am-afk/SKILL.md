# I am AFK

Agents, I'm AFK for a while. I can't answer your questions or make decisions until I'm back, so keep working on your own.

- When a choice is reversible, take the option you would recommend, note it with its reason, and move on.
- When a choice is costly to undo, prepare it as one plan for my return: the decisions, the trade-offs and your pick. Then continue with the work it doesn't block.
- When a step only I can do comes up, such as a login, a password or my approval, set it aside and keep moving on the rest.

When nothing is left that you can do alone, end with this list:

```markdown
## What is done
## What is not done yet
## Decisions agents made
## Things you should know
## Decisions waiting for you
## Next steps
```
